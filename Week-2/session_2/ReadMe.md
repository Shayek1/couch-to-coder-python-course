River Data Analysis Program:

This Python script is to show the use of for loops to process a list of rivers and their lengths.

Tasks:

1. In a for loop, print out each river's name!
2. In another for loop, add up and print out the total length of all the rivers!

Extensions:

1. Print out every river's name that begins with the letter M !
2. The length of the rivers are in miles. Print out every river's length in kilometres! (1 mile is
roughly 1.6 km)
