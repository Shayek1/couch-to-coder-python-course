Volkswagen Car Listings Analysis:

This Python project analyses a CSV file containing car listings for Volkswagen vehicles in the UK. Using Python's csv module, as well as pandas and matplotlib for data visualization, this script provides insights into the data.



Base tasks:

Using the csv package, read in the data from the vw.csv file, and turn
them into a list of dicts or a list of namedtuples.
Answer the following questions:
1. What is the most expensive VW car listed?
2. Find all the VW Golf models. What is their average price?
3. What is the average milage for VW Polo models registered in 2020?

Extension: Using pandas and matplotlib , create the following:
1. A pie chart showing the distribution between fuel types. (You can use the model column
to count occurances!)
2. A bar chart showing the average mileage for each model. (You need to research how
can you calculate average using pandas!)
